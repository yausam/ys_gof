    "    Used to minimize memory usage and improve performance by sharing common state between multiple objects. \n",
    "    It achieves this by storing shared state externally and passing it to the objects that need it, \n",
    "rather than each object storing its own copy of the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Flyweight pattern is particularly useful in situations where a large number \n",
    "of similar objects need to be created, and memory usage is a concern. \n",
    "    By sharing common state, it reduces the memory footprint of the application and improves its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main components of the Flyweight pattern are:\n",
    "1.  Flyweight: This is the interface through which flyweights are able to receive and act on extrinsic state.\n",
    "2.  Concrete Flyweight: This is a concrete implementation of the Flyweight interface. It is responsible \n",
    "for managing its own state and providing an implementation of the Flyweight interface.\n",
    "3.  Flyweight Factory: This is responsible for managing a pool of flyweight objects and ensuring that \n",
    "flyweights are shared properly. It is also responsible for creating and returning an existing flyweight \n",
    "if it already exists, or creating a new one if it does not.\n",
    "4.  Client: This is the class that uses the Flyweight pattern. It is responsible for passing extrinsic state to the flyweight objects.\n",
