    "    Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. \n",
    "    This pattern is useful when an object's behavior depends on its state, \n",
    "and it needs to change its behavior dynamically at runtime based on its internal state.\n",
    "    State pattern helps to encapsulate the behavior associated with each state into separate state objects, \n",
    "making it easier to add new states and modify behavior without modifying the context class (or client coee) directly.\n",
    "    (!) The client interacts with the context without being aware of the specific state transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main components of the State pattern are:\n",
    "1.  Context: maintains a reference to the current state object and forwards requests to the state object.\n",
    "2.  State: defines an interface for encapsulating the behavior associated with a particular state of the context.\n",
    "3.  ConcreteState: implements the behavior associated with a particular state of the context.\n",
    "4.  Client: creates a context object and configures it with a state object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples/usage:\n",
    "1.  Order processing in e-commerce. Order may go through different states such as \"pending\", \"processing\", \"shipped\",\n",
    "and \"delivered\". The behavior of the order  is impacted (e.g., allowing cancellation, updating shipping information) \n",
    "2.  Games: the behavior of characters changes based on the state (e.g., \"idle\", \"moving\", \"attacking\", \"defending\").\n",
