    "    The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder \n",

    "3.  Proxy: It is the object that acts as a surrogate for the RealSubject, controlling access to it.\n",
    "4.  Client: It is the class that uses the Proxy to request the RealSubject to perform a certain action.\n",
    "5.  Lazy initialization: It is a design pattern that delays the creation of an object until the first time it is needed.\n",
    "6.  Access control: It is a design pattern that restricts access to certain parts of the system.\n",
