    "    The Command pattern decouples the sender of a request (the invoker) from the object \n",
    "that executes the request (the receiver). \n",
    "    This allows you to create flexible and reusable components where commands can be easily \n",
    "swapped in and out without modifying the invoker or the receiver.\n",
    "    It promotes encapsulation, loose coupling, and separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main components of the Command pattern are:\n",
    "1.  Command: declares an interface for executing an operation.\n",
    "2.  ConcreteCommand: implements the Command interface and defines the binding between the\n",
    "receiver object and the action.\n",
    "3.  Receiver: knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request.\n",
    "4.  Invoker: asks the command to carry out the request.\n",
    "5.  Client: creates a ConcreteCommand object and sets its receiver.\n",

    "2.  Remote control\n",
