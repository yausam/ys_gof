    "    Subject maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them of any state changes, \n",
    "usually by calling one of their methods. \n",
    "    This allows multiple objects to listen and react to changes in another object \n",
    "without tightly coupling them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Many Objects of the Same Observer Class: \n",
    "    Multiple components in a graphical user interface (GUI) that need to react to changes in a model, \n",
    "many instances of the same observer class created to observe the model.\n",
    "    Multiple Observer Classes:\n",
    "    A system where some observers need to perform specific actions when a certain event occurs, \n",
    "while others need to perform different actions - multiple observer classes to handle different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main components of the Observer pattern are:\n",
    "1.  Subject: Maintains a list of observers, facilitates adding or removing observers.\n",
    "2.  Observer: Provides an update interface for objects that need to be notified of a Subject's changes of state.\n",
    "3.  ConcreteSubject: Broadcasts notifications to observers on changes of state, stores the state of ConcreteObservers.\n",
    "4.  ConcreteObserver: Stores a reference to the ConcreteSubject, implements an update interface for the Observer \n",
    "to ensure state is consistent with the Subject's.\n",
    "5.  Client: Creates a ConcreteSubject and ConcreteObserver to maintain state consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples/usage:\n",
    "1.  GUI applications, e.g a button in a GUI which performs some action when clicked.\n",
    "2.  Distributed Systems, e.g. Kafka where a message is broadcast to multiple consumers.\n",
    "2.  A stock market application that allows traders to get notified when the price of a stock reaches a certain value.\n",
    "4.  A chat application that allows users to get notified when a new message is received.\n",
    "5.  Event handling in general, where the publisher is the event source and the subscribers are the event listeners.\n",
