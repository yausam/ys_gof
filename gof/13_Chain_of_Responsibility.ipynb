    "    The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern where multiple objects \n",
    "are chained together, and each object in the chain has the opportunity to process a request \n",
    "or pass it on to the next object in the chain. \n",
    "    The idea is to decouple the sender of a request from its receiver \n",
    "by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main components of the Chain of Responsibility pattern are:\n",
    "1.  Handler: An interface for handling requests.\n",
    "2.  ConcreteHandler: A concrete handler that implements the Handler interface.\n",
    "3.  Client: The client that initiates the request.\n",

    "1.  Online order/e-commerce.Each handler in the chain can check various aspects of the order, \n",
    "    such as payment processing, inventory availability, and shipping options, \n",
    "    before passing the order to the next handler.\n",
    "2.  A series of security checks.\n",
