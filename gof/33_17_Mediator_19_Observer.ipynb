    "Patterns:\n",
    "- Mediator Pattern: The mediator centralizes complex communications and controls between objects, \n",
    "known as colleagues. In the context of transactions and market participants, the mediator would manage \n",
    "the interactions among transactions (e.g., starting, authorizing, and completing transactions) without \n",
    "them needing to directly reference each other.\n",
    "- Observer Pattern: The observer pattern allows objects (observers) to subscribe and react to events \n",
    "in other objects (subjects). In our case, transactions would be the subjects, and market participants \n",
    "would be the observers. When a transaction changes state (e.g., authorized, completed), \n",
    "it would notify all subscribed market participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Meditator:\n",
    "- Transaction Authorization and Cancellation: The Mediator now has a crucial role in deciding whether transactions \n",
    "are authorized for execution or need to be cancelled. This decision could be based on more complex logic \n",
    "than demonstrated, such as checking against fraud detection algorithms, ensuring sufficient funds, \n",
    "or meeting regulatory requirements.\n",
    "- Dynamic Observer Management: Though not explicitly demonstrated in the code, the Mediator could facilitate \n",
    "adding or removing observers from transactions based on certain events or conditions. \n",
    "For instance, if a transaction is marked for review, the Mediator could add auditors as observers.\n",
    "- Centralized Control and Decision-Making: The Mediator's enhanced role demonstrates how it can centralize control \n",
    "over transactions' lifecycle, making it easier to implement changes to the process without modifying each transaction class. \n",
    "This illustrates the Mediator's value in managing complex interactions and decision-making processes in a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "PS. In theory, transactions could block each other or may need other for of interaction.\n",
    "This could be implemented in the Mediator class.\n",
